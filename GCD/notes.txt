Euclid's algorithm (Euclidean algorithm)

Algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers, the largest number that divides both
of them without leaving a remainder.

The algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change 
if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

Time complexity: log(x + y), where x and y are input numberd. 

Least common multiple (LCM):
		
		LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)
