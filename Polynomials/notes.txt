Algorithms related to the manipulation with polynomials

A single polynomial can be represented with an array but if it has a lot of coefficients equal to 0
(ex. p(x) = 1 + x^1000) then it is, regarding the memory, more efficient to represent the polynomial
with the linked list. A particular item in the list contains the coefficient and the corresponding 
power.
This method can be used for matrices as well (sparse matrix).

Polynomials can also be in the following form: r0(x-r1)(x-r2)...(x-rN)
